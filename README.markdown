Spree Bookable Extension
=========

Spree extension to add 'Bookable' products. A bookable product has a user selectable start and/or end date, configurable in the product admin. The extension adds date slectors to the product pages where appropriate, and also summarises the selected dates in the cart and order summary. 

Currently confirmed working with Spree branch 0\_8\_99 as of September 16. Check/update to 0.9.0 soon.
